# DBServer

I'm working on this course from udemy to implement a database server in java.


https://www.udemy.com/course/became-a-better-java-coder-create-database-server-in-java/


I'm at the very beginning at lecture 16.  I'm getting different values for the row numbers,
than what is being shown in the course. 

If anybody reads this, feel free to look over the code and see if you see anything bizarre that
might be causing the different values issue.

Thanks
